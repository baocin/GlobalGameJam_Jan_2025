A realistic, detailed fish (e.g., trout, salmon, or goldfish) isolated on a clean transparent background. Focus on natural anatomy: lifelike scales, fins, and gills with subtle texture, neutral studio lighting for even illumination, and muted natural colors (greys, silvers, oranges, or whites). No surreal effects, patterns, or stylization. Sharp focus, high-resolution, and plain empty space around the fish. Style: Photographic accuracy, true-to-life rendering.
