Serene underwater aquarium scene with no fish, focusing on a lush, detailed environment. Vibrant coral reefs in soft pastel hues, swaying sea plants, and textured rock formations covered in algae. Sunlight streams through crystal-clear water, creating shimmering ripples and refracted light patterns on a sandy ocean floor. Delicate bubbles rise from hidden crevices, with faint reflections of the water's surface above. Hyper-realistic textures, cinematic depth of field, and a tranquil teal-and-emerald color palette. Style: Photorealistic, with a focus on intricate details and ethereal underwater atmosphere.
